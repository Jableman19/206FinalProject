Statistical analysis of genre in media based on scraped data and public APIs

## mobyGames.py
This file grabs games from different genres and then scrapes the website to get the different scores
to use this file you will have to generate and insert your own mobygames API key -- however running
the file is not necessary as the db with the results is included here on github

## goodreads.py
This file scrapes semi-randomly chosen goodreads genre pages and collects the review scores of all the books on
the page - entering them into our books.db database.
